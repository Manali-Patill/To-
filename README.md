The To-Do list application contains features like adding tasks and their descriptions. 
It allows users to filter notes based on colors, such as red for incomplete tasks and green for completed tasks. 
Users can also update any existing tasks. 
Task deletion is an added feature with a confirmation box using JavaScript. 
This project is great for beginners starting with the Python Django framework, as it provides a lot of learning opportunities.
